  <h1 style='color: lightskyblue'>How it works</h1>
  <h4 style='color:white'>This website is an advertising site which is designed to allow the user to issue repair offers for a given car part. 
    The mechanics can review these offers and then accept one of them and commit to repair it. Both users and mechanics 
    can add offers, because we assume that some mechanics will want to order the repair of their parts to other mechanics in case they can not fix the part</h4>
